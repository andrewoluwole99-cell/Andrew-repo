PROJECT: SEN assignment

Project Description (First Project – Hello World) This project is a simple Python program developed as part of the SEN 201 task. The program displays the message “Hello” on the screen using Python.

Assignment 2 focuses on the design and implementation of a software system using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). In this assignment, a Student Result Management System (SRMS) was developed to demonstrate the practical application of software engineering principles. The system is a console-based application that allows an administrator to add student records, record academic results, and view stored information. The development followed the Waterfall SDLC model, covering requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
The system was implemented using the Python programming language with a modular structure to ensure clarity and maintainability. It accepts inputs such as Student ID, Name, Department, Course, and Score, which are stored using file-based storage. A sample data insertion feature was included to support testing and demonstration. All names and nomenclatures used during the design phase were consistently applied in the implementation, ensuring alignment between system design and code.
